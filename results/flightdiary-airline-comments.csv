In flight services, you have to pay if you want some food (typical of low cost Airlines) but you can pay with different currencies to pay with yours country money. For the in flight entertainment I didn't expect something as a low costs company so bring your tablet (tablet to get it in your one bagage) or your laptop to have some entertainment if you are bored.

When the plane actually arrived, the first words that greeted us was well were going to be moving just before the magic 3 hours so you cannot claim compensation. Not very comforting words to hear when travelling with young children, maybe a 'HELLO' or 'LETS SEE IF WE CAN HELP YOU GET YOUR LUGGAGE AND CHILDREN ON THE AIRCRAFT' would have been much better. When the plane started boarding we were ushered to the front of the aircraft, only to find the seats were at the back!

Boarding from AUH was a little confusing as I was going to the states; they have pre clearance and the lounge is a little ways from the boarding area and they try to keep you there until it's time... to mean, boarding means you are getting on the air craft, not getting into the boarding area.","","10209454305783540","0","1742857","false","Andre Jones","3","4","null","10 months ago","1.493049248947206E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/ApolloGenito"

Sometimes, the boarding process is not handled very well at the airport, but the same could happen to any airline.

I got a full refund for my accommodation in the ash cloud case, and Easyjet organised accommodation, food and buses in the second case.

This means that passengers are forced to queue outside for about 45 minutes and then have to rush back to the plane. Inadequate queing room and signage means arrivals passengers get mixed up with the transit passengers and slow tbe transit security check/boarding.  The airport is just not up to this job.  As Air Asia is a cut price airline they charge for water for passengers. Those passengers with partially full water bottles which they had to take from the plane had to give these up at security check and were not given time to refill them  = rip-off.
Next time I will fly AKL-KUL direct and avoid Australian incompetance and will pay big bucks to avoid transit at Gold Coast.
KUL was fine and being bussed from the plane at AKL was done with reasonable efficiency but Gold Coast airport is definitely third world in efficiency for this flight.","","","0","2016921","false","Lloyd Weeber","1","1","null","3 months ago","1.493049259226196E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Lloydkiwi"

"ReviewItem","90","Used to be my favorite airline but since Maidan events their service took a hit. No more free meals or coffee. Meals and drinks with money are ok and not badly priced. Panorama in flight magazine is very good, i always read it from cover2cover. UIAs flights are easily delayed without explanations. Some short haul planes are new and the older ones well kept but B767 long haul planes are very outdated, no entertainment systems.... it's painful to travel 8+ hours, even in business class (yes, tried that too). However, staff are very friendly and women are amazing hotties :) Ground service is not so good, especially at KBP airport. UIA has really weird flight pricing and stupid discounts, for example discount on your birthday. Idea is great but it is so hard to get it... basically you can get it only from airport desk. Another weird thing is that some of their connecting flights are way cheaper than flights to kiev only. I will never understand this. Also some of their flight routes have no sense at all and will end up burning their money only. UIAs social media service is great and fast. Would i still use UIA?  Yes but its not my 1st option anymore.","","928117843898428","84","1439471","false","LasseL","1","12","null","2 years ago","1.49304926123428E9","1","3","http://flightdiary.net/lepolal"

Now, I expected Scoot to take advantage of the advanced environmental systems onboard their new 787 dreamliner, but somehow that didn't seem to be the case. The air was still pretty dry and it was noticeable warm inside the cabin. AND THE PLANE DOES NOT HAVE A WATER COOLER ON BOARD OMG. 
The flight crew were decent but not outstanding. They seemed more concerned of getting their duties done in a manner that throws asian hospitality out of the window. My partner was told to stow his bag under his seat at least 3 times, even though he was trying to pack his things during all 3 occasions (the seatbelt sign wasn't on and we were still a fair bit away from descending, mind you).

The Jetstar it's a low cost airline, that with an acceptable price allow you to have a good trip even when it's a long distance. The airplane was an airbus a 320-200, average space for legs and acceptable air temperature on board. The staff was good though in one occasion some of them had a panic reaction during some turbolence. Overall , it's a good airline, and for what you pay I think it's pretty pleasant and fast.

While other low cost airlines think the opposite, and the passenger thanks the airline for having transported them safely by paying them not too much.
I had a major delay on the departure time, but this is not a reason to blame an airline. There were air traffic restrictions, but the pilot talked about a technical failure and a replacement plane (arrived within 2 hours). Another time I had my flight cancelled, got refunded but they still caused me some troubles.

Swiss European (or, should I say, Swiss') problem is that they use a variant of aircraft which has a claustrophobic cabin and is beginning to show its age. On the London City to Geneva route, for example, are BA Cityflyer's Embraer E170 and E190 aircraft - both of which have a 2+2 (not 3+2) cabin layout, quieter engines and taller ceilings which make them a better travelling experience. Swiss also offers a limited and somewhat low quality food and beverage selection.

"ReviewItem","391","We have been delayed for 7 hours because of an unspecified technical issue. We started from THR, fly for about 20 minutes and then they claimedd &quot;Don't worry, we will go back to the Mehrhabad&quot;. We indeed landed back and have been deplaned. After about 2 hours of waiting we get some airplane style lunch, but no informations whether we fly or when. Fellow travelers check situation with other airlines, but there no free seats on the Shiraz route in the nexxt two days. Then we boarded the same plane, but we did not even depart, because of the same technical issue. Positive thing is, that they were not risking our lives. However passangers went really angry and forced the crew to do something and finally we get another plane after about 7 hours and departed. Then everything went smooth and we even get dinner onboard - which a very rare thing on such short domestic flight, considering european standards. I am not sure whether I will be booking any domestic flights in Iran in the future, but maybe only for legs you can't do other way, e.g. Kish Island.","","","57","1443139","false","Kamil","1","60","null","2 years ago","1.49304929066205E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/pungentodour"

I feel that most FAs were quite keen and willing to help though. My special meal order (low fat) was not fulfilled at breakfast. They spend a lot of time looking for it (to no avail) and offers me two entrees instead (a vegetarian and a regular &quot;western&quot;). The problem is (1) they could neither speak or understand most proper English so although they seemed nicer to non-Chinese/Asian-looking passengers, it was really hard to talk to them and (2) the airline sucked so badly that they could not help improve the impression much.","","1039090619535908","0","1981648","false","Andrew Hao","2","3","null","3 months ago","1.493049302050664E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/AndrewRHao"

The movies were average this time around - for some reason there was no comedy section on the in flight entertainment.... kind of weird.  But I worked on my laptop when I wasn't sleeping so it doesn't matter.

The Economy seats were comfortable with enough padding, winged headrest, and adequately sized IFE monitor. This aircraft, A6-ECD is also fitted with live TV channels including CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera among others. I'm quite certain this live channel service is not rolled out across their fleet as I have flown on many of their aircraft and have not seen it on any other aircraft (including their 380s). Having said that, their in-flight wifi is also reasonably priced and had no connection issues whatsoever.","","","84","1358441","false","Khai Phoon Tnay","1","3","null","3 years ago","1.493049324506753E9","0","8","http://flightdiary.net/khaiphoon"

Emirates cuisine is great and the addition of a bar serving snacks and drinks is an added bonus on the A380. I'm 5 feet 8 inches tall and could lie flat when the seats were fully reclined on both b777 and a380. The seats can be adjusted multiple ways and have different massage settings which are great on a long flight. The entertainment system is the best, with a great selection of movies and music which you can use to create your own play list.  Plenty of overhead storage. Priority bioarding and excellent business lounges. Great value.

The 2hr delay at Changi resulted in a 1 hr late arrival. Fortunately, had a 2hr connection in Dubai. Unfortunately, Emirates wouldn't let us connect and put us on the later Boston flight. Somehow our luggage made it to Boston on the earlier flight. ???? I complained to Emirates, they gave me extra miles. It's worthless because I'm not flying them to Boston.

Boarding is efficient and most stations are now pro-active at getting families and passengers needing assistance on board early.
The cabin crew are generally excellent - they're helpful and polite especially when travelling with children. 
Food is pretty good for an airline - I've never had a bad meal and the kids love their special meals.  There's some nice touches like the packets of crackers and dipping things with chilli sauce.
Seats are good on the A380 - some of the 777 fleet are showing their age now. IFE is superb and you'd be hard pushed not to find something to keep you entertained.

"ReviewItem","808","UA, like most US carriers have fallen way behind in terms of level of service.  Flying east from Europe long haul and within Europe short haul you get used to a particular level of service, but US carriers seem to have fallen for the RyanAir/SouthWestern model.  This does not work beyond short haul and Easjet and other European carriers provide ample evidence that even on short haul there is a better way.  I would note that on long haul there is no price difference between flying east and west from Europe per mile, yet service flying east is in a different league.

"ReviewItem","808","This is the airline I have flown most flights with. I can say it's pretty average. For American standards a little above average, but if we were to consider European standards it's definitely below average. The boarding and the on time performance improved quite a lot lately. The crew seemed OK to me. Their terminals are in general pretty good. The in flight experience in general is not too pleasant. Seats are pretty crammed. They also invented a new class called economy-plus to extract more money from passengers. Luckily for me, my height is not above average, so I'm fine with the pure economy class. 
They were smart enough to acquire the best American airline, Continental, but now, even the planes they got from Continental, they converted into crowded places.","","1105983","66","1349606","false","MihaiA","15","10","null","3 years ago","1.493049342598079E9","1","0","http://flightdiary.net/mamarie"

"ReviewItem","808","This is probably the most pathetic established airline that I know. Their stuff is not prepared to do their duties, also they do not accept credit cards from any countries they do not fly to which leads to situation that you cannot buy anything on board and not even pay for you luggage during check in. In-flight entertainment comparing to delta is a joke. I wish they were not part of Star Alliance - with my next flights I will not select Star Alliance if there is a single leg covered by United.

They went on about how great their service was as they have a 5 course meal. It was terrible and one of the courses was a bottle of water. 

They still have the TV in the front of the cabin and everyone has to listen in. I don't know how United can remain compedative in todays market when they offer the worst service for the same price as QANTAS who provides amazing everything.

I saw poeple with two carry-ons and a personal bag boarding the plane and because I had to board later, had to give it up. I'm really disappointed.

"ReviewItem","808","I've been flying United for many years. You can definitely notice the constant slow decrease the level of confort over that period. I'm not a tall, or fat guy, but even myself I start finding the economy class seats to be pretty small. I was recently flying on a B738 and I noticed that there are now there about 40 rows of seats, that including 4 business class rows. That tells something about how they push the limits of confort on a plane.
The boarding process is pretty smooth and the crew is nice as always. The in flight entertainment is quite poor and they charge for it. Most respected airlines have the option to track the position of the flight on a map. Not for United, in fact most US domestic flights lack that for some reason. I can't believe people are not interested in knowing where they are. I'll keep flying United, as I have many miles with them, but they should know that there are limits.","","1105983","66","1460730","false","MihaiA","7","10","null","1 year ago","1.493049344211589E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/mamarie"

"ReviewItem","154","It may be a low cost airline, it's absolutely not a low budget airline! Their prices can be as high as 'all inclusive' airlines, without getting the same product. They're the best option to fly to the Baltics. Seats are generally comfortable enough for the duration of the flight (short haul anyway), although their fleet is mostly a bit outdated. I'm very much looking forward to see the new Bombardier C-series in action though! It would be great if the company could at least serve some coffee or tea free of charge. The business class product is generally not worth the price in comparison to what you get. Their on time record seems decent: I only experienced a 30 minute delay once, which they mostly made up again during the flight. Riga is a small enough airport to allow for the short connections AirBaltic offers. Staff on board is generally very friendly. Ground staff can be very strict, especially when it comes to following up rules about hand luggage. Overall, they have their flaws, butI would fly with them again.

"ReviewItem","223","They're usually a great airline.  Today they had an IT meltdown for the second time in less than a year.  It meant a lot of confusion, though I do give them credit for getting me home.  I arrived at DTW to find that there was a systemwide outage.  I waited around at the gate that was indicated. When a different plane pulled into our gate, nobody knew where we should go...so we waited. Suddenly the gate assignment changes. We confirm the gate has changed, and head that way.  Got to the gate, and it said it was headed to a very different city. That agent had no clue which destination was supposed to be at that gate.  It was our gate, but the sign kept getting switched back and forth. Main control couldn't figure it out. It ended up we enplaned about 20 minutes late, and sat there... We kept thinking we'd leave, and then a few more people would show up. And then we found out someone had accidentally boarded our plane headed to the other destination. It was a comedy of errors....Delta could have made better announcements during the whole process.","","2328189","100","2007036","false","Jonathan","4","24","null","3 months ago","1.493049362613396E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/gittinsj"
"ReviewItem","223","Best in-flight crews of any US airline, by far. The ground staff is good, too. Aircraft interiors are well-kept and they appear to have more aircraft with entertainment than their competitors. Sadly, Delta, like most carriers, doesn't do well during irregular operations. For example, during a ground stop for arriving and departing flights at LGA due to Donald Trump's plane leaving, they closed the door for the GSP flight on time and would not re-open it for me - I ran from the adjacent terminal because my inbound connection was late. The GSP flight sat there for 17 minutes and they would not let me on. Instead, I got re-routed through ATL, making it a two stop journey for a 900-mile trip.  Par for the course for most airlines, but this prevents me from giving Delta 5-stars.","","1408764779","0","2002538","false","727stretch (Dave)","4","2","null","3 months ago","1.493049362613917E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/727stretch"

"ReviewItem","223","Delta was very good to us. We had some major problems though which they handled very well. Our first flight (Intended to be DEN-SLC), was delayed, so we would have missed our connecting flight. Delta recognized this problem before we even checked in, and we talked with a representative who helped us get a new flight to Grand Forks. 

For the delay, Delta provided us with 45$ for meals in Denver.

After a 6 hour delay in Denver, we finally boarded our new flight to Minneapolis. The horror continued with two maintenance delays, preventing us from leaving for anther 4 hours. Everyone has rebooked if they were to miss their connecting flights. Those who stayed on the flight were given free food (The over-priced airline food), which helped with the delay. 

We did miss our connecting flight in Minneapolis, however. Since there were no more flights to Grand Forks that night, Delta paid for us to stay in a hotel, and provided us with our luggage, and a free toiletry bag for our trouble. They also rebooked us to our original destination (Fargo), on a flight that was supposed to be unavailable. We arrived in the morning.

I was very surprised and happy as to how we were treated by Delta. They were exceptional at providing for us, and kept trying to mitigate the delay.

They stole some of my stuff from my checked-in luggage - I lost some clothes, liquids and headlight. The luggage was open when I had to pick it up in Calcutta - they probably opened it for a check-up but didn't close. So maybe some of my things just felt off on flight or during unloading.

Their briefing is about flight path, speed, altitude, weather etc., which somehow gives better feeling and reassurance especially during mid air flight.","","","0","1427334","false","Sachin Jha","2","10","null","2 years ago","1.493049372105661E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/sachin"
"ReviewItem","1122","Domestic travel with Indigo has been good provided my flights had been of duration in range of 2 Hrs. They would provide meal only if pre-booked else you have to buy.
Food can cost you anything from Rs. 50 (~ $1) to Rs. 300 (~ $5)
Flight crew are courteous and I will rate them good.
There are no inflight entertainment and WiFi is not there in Indian sky.
PA are more than other airlines, we are briefed in detail before take off, at cruise levels, descending levels. For me, it gives some comfort while someone from cockpit gives you detail on radio, you can make out from the voice that everything is in control and let's relax :)
Even if the PA is something like &quot;We are expecting slight turbulence...&quot;","","","0","1412952","false","Sachin Jha","2","10","null","2 years ago","1.493049372105933E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/sachin"

"ReviewItem","239","When it comes to shorthaul flying, Lufthansa is an ok airline. I always enjoyed flying with them. Unfortunately in recent years they have decided to transform itself into a more hybrid carrier. This was a bad move in my opinion. 
They are a legacy carrier that tries to have some characteristics of a lowcost airline (paying to chose a seat, luggage fees...) while mostly operating as a legacy one. This schizophrenic behaviour will not be good for their business. 

Long-haul is another matter, there they rock. However, given that Norwegian has been expanding here, I wonder how long they will last before destroying the quality of the service they offer.","","701400726","25","1458669","false","Nemanja Shukalo","14","12","null","1 year ago","1.493049407240359E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Nemjee"

Lufthansa on regional European flights are great. Experienced them on the Airbus A319 A320 A321, Boeing 737-500 and Embraer E190 - comfortable seats although not always in good condition (doesn't affect comfortability). Leg room is decent compared to the likes of Ryanair and even BA Gatwick aircraft (I've noticed). Some cabin crew are straight faced 24/7, some really cheery - a mixed bag. On their 3.5 hour flight from FRA to GOJ (Russia) they served hot dinner/breakfast , whilst on european mainland flights to London, Italy etc, tasty small snacks - generous on drinks!","","","0","1765510","false","Anthony Maffei","10","11","null","9 months ago","1.493049408907461E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/amaffei"

"ReviewItem","239","My last Lufthansa flight have been one of the best economy flying experiences. The crew is very friendly and the Individual In-flight entertainment system has a very large selection of well picked movies and TV shows. The food tasted amazing. Almost Business class style in economy. The only thing bothering me was the long boarding procedure in Frankfurt, getting on the A380, but I guess that is to be expected with the biggest airliner in the world. There were some noisy and bothering (drunk) guests in front of me but after asking the flight attendant, she got up and made sure evrerything was nice and quiet again. Overall, the airline improved greatly and offers great services.","","1685870738328830","100","1744847","false","Joschua","10","2","null","10 months ago","1.493049408908931E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/joschpilot"

"ReviewItem","795","При регистрации в аэропорту Сочи работало две стойки регистрации, которые оформляли 2 рейса B767 в Москву и рейс в Петербург. Стоек регистрации было явно не достаточно. Стойка N28 drop-off не работала вообще. Экипаж ВС работал хорошо и слаженно. Салон воздушного судна требует обновления, так как устарел морально и физически - не работали некоторые лампы салонного освещения, хотя шаг кресел порадовал - было просторно.

"ReviewItem","795","Трансаэро хуже авиакомпании лоукостеров. На 4,5 часов перелет не дают подушек и пледов, при цене билета в 20 000руб. Питание ужасное, персонал вроде ничего. Самолеты хорошо отремонтированы и им предан современный вид, по факту же, старые и списанные борта. Они гордятся тем, что у них самый большой авиапарк дальнемагистральных самолетов, при этом, не упоминают года их постройки и экспуатации. Из 10 ресов 9 вылетят не вовремя. Авиакомпания экономит и не платит за телескопический трап, доставляя пассажиров автобусами ( аэропорт Внуково) WIFI на борту за 300 руб час.","","100001475810177","60","1387940","false","Arseniy Gorbachev","1","16","null","2 years ago","1.493049417423492E9","1","3","http://flightdiary.net/ArseniyG"

"ReviewItem","795","Transaero sells cheap tickets like a low-cost carrier but provides service of good quality. For example, you may check-in online to your flight for free, carry bagagge up to 20 kg weight and even be served candies and food on the board.

However, the food is not enought to be full. So it might make sense to eat before your flight.

On some flights Transaero provides Wi-Fi (this service called Transaero Connect). At the moment I flew the price was 300 rubles (about $5) for one hour and 600 rubles (about $10) for the whole flight time. The internet connection is fast and mostly stable, but sometimes may be interrupted for a few minutes. The service is bought directly onboard. You just need connect to onboard Wi-Fi and pay with your credit card at the gateway page.","","955975577793057","0","1445976","false","shelbalart","2","9","null","2 years ago","1.493049420954776E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/shelbalart"
"ReviewItem","795","Transaero could be a really cool airline, unless the crew. First time I had a flight with them and by entering the aircraft I was surprised by a reaaly spacious and fancy plane. They even got internet onboad, this time it costed 600 RUB to have it for the whole flight, 300 RUB/hour. The main bad point is the crew. It seems that the &quot;service&quot; conception haven't yet hit Transaero. The stewardesses seemed pissed and digusted by the passengers, wouldn't go the &quot;extra mile&quot;, well actually the wouldn't even smile. Had to ask for a cup of water 3 times and they ignored my ringing for 15 minutes without any plausible reason, plus generall unpleasantness.

They told us they give our reserved seats away if we didn't pick them up 1 hour before departure, which is impossible because we were on an Air Canada flight, connecting with the London flight.
Anyway, no help at the transfer desk, no help at the gate and no help onboard the aircraft.

I ordered an A320 model plane, but I got home to find it was broken.

Flight entertainment: Only over-head screens and the same videos are repeated in each flight.

Overall 4/5 for a budget airline.","","","0","1930030","false","Zakariya Al Zakwani","1","5","null","4 months ago","1.493049426296192E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Zakariya"

They have been absolutely excellent in almost everything. Food was perfect, service as well. In Guangzhou they gave me transit visa and free hotel on both, inbound and outbound flights. Cabin crew was excellent and nice and polite. For me 5/5 stars and better service than Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and absolutely uncomparable to Czech Airlines. I can recommend China South Airlines to everyone and I will use their service again.

Some crew members have difficulty with English, and the accent of the announcements can be hard to understand. They will always try to help.

On most long haul flights, the seats are equipped with seat back TVs and USB charging ports. There is a wide range of Chinese and Western content to occupy your time.

Food is plentiful and of a decent quality (as far as airline food goes).

If you have a ticketed overnight connection through Guangzhou (and both flights are operated by China Southern), they will provide a complimentary hotel room on request (including shuttle to the hotel).

Even then the seat pitch was a little tight and if the person in front reclines fully, you're still pretty much going to suffer some form of claustrophobia. No IFE, save for the dropdown screens in the middle rows displaying flight information and pretty much nothing else. Staff however provided a decent level of service and spoke good enough English for foreigners to understand. When our aircraft was delayed on the ground due to air traffic control, crew went around distributing drinks. For a short hop, the meal was rather substantial: a snack box containing water and a bun, plus additional hotdog or noodles.","","1100438706","70","1386762","false","Hafiz Bam","1","48","null","2 years ago","1.493049428440115E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/hafizbam"

If you don't, they'll be happy to rent one to you for the duration of the flight for a price where you could pay a bit more and order your own knockoff online.","","","61","1412995","false","Christina Strynatka","6","35","null","2 years ago","1.49304943347962E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/cstrynatka"
"ReviewItem","13","AC like most legacy carriers can be hit or miss, also your impression might depend largely on your status.

Like - Consistency, fleet, overall.

Dislike - Crews, food, entertainment.

When I get an AC itinerary and see the aircrafts, I know exactly what I'm getting.  I can't say the same for AA/DL/UA it seems like those are all crapshoot as far as wifi/streaming entertainment/avod old/avod new/live tv.  I hate that.  I also generally like the overall experience on AC, it may not be overly positive, but I've also had very few negative experiences. The fleet also while it's not new (though it's getting newer) I find to be fairly comfortable.  Even on the worst flights I'm ok with my seats on AC, though express flights can be a bit of a chore.

The crews/service on AC are what hold them back.  Personally I've never really gotten a RUDE crew, but you'll often get, simply professional and short.  For me that's ok, except it would be nice if you appeared to enjoy your job, even if you're just serving me a coke.  There are exceptions of course on both ends and my experience has leaned more towards positive.  But lots of people report otherwise.

The food is mediocre, that's kinda par for the course in air travel, but even the business class food while ok is only presented ok, tastes decent, is of decent size.  Nothing really stands out.  There's no signature cookie.  There's no hot nuts.  It's little things.  It also kinda sucks when there's only 2 choices on the menu and they run out of one, I know it happens but it's only ever happened to me on AC.

The AVOD-old system which is on 90% of the aircrafts is OK.  It's also certainly better than nothing.  Many people complain about it, but with a calm patient touch I get what I need out of it.  I wish narrowbody flights had as many movies as widebody ones, not sure why they don't but oh well.  Widebody flights by no means have a huge wealth of films, but it's decent.  Unless you're a really frequent flier or a huge movie goer (I'm kinda both unfortunately lol) then there's likely something there you haven't seen and wanted to, and something you have seen that you'd like to watch again.  That'll get you through a decent chunk of the flight.  Don't forget to explore the &quot;contemporary&quot; and &quot;Canadian&quot; sections too, sometimes gems are hidden in those categories even if they feel like they should be in the new releases area.

I rated Wifi at 0 but that's more because it's not too widely available and I think it's overpriced like with all airlines.","","","0","1472657","false","brett armstrong","5","5","null","1 year ago","1.493049433587848E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/drvannostren"

"ReviewItem","13","A lot has been written about the high density configuration 777's on Air Canada and none that I've read is any good. The &quot;pod&quot; system in business class is absolutely terrible! As you put the seat into the flat position, your feet are pushed into what can only be described as a coffin. There is no room to uncross/cross your legs, you cannot bend your legs without first putting the seat at least halfway back into the seated position, truly an uncomfortable experience. The crew were delightful and had a lengthy discussion about the seating configuration and it appears that the number 1 gripe from business passengers is the &quot;pod&quot; style seating. I am astonished that somebody from Air Canada actually said, &quot;yes these seats will be just what our passengers want&quot;. I wonder if they still have a job? Food was good. Nobody to meet the aircraft on arrival at YVR so had a 20 minute wait to get off. Overall, would have only given 1 star but the nice crew brought it up to 2.

"ReviewItem","836","We had a terible experience with Westjet recently on our flight from Toronto Pearson to Quebec. Our flight got cancelled after two hours of delays, due to the bad weather at Ottawa airport (departure airport of the aircraft, but not ours). Airport crew quickly told us that the next flight is next day in the morning (in more than 14 hours). We got negatively surprised when we were told that westjet bears no responsibility for cancellations of this type and we have to figure out where to spend the whole night ourselves. Futhermore, no food vouchers or anything was offered. The next day check-in was a chaos and we spent more than an hour to check-in our luggage (the day before we also spent almost an hour). They were terribly understaffed both days, thus many people around us missed their flights solely due to the long queues, even having arrived two hours in advance. Some staff members were even openly laughing at a spanish lady (their client) who spoke little english, rather than trying to help her. Very unpleasant.","","","0","1441915","false","A J","3","1","null","2 years ago","1.493049439324806E9","1","0","http://flightdiary.net/bumbum"

Yes, I'm a tall guy... 1,95m... But not unusually tall... But i can only fit into the seats in Economy with my knees directly against the seat in front without any space... And if someone is sitting in the seat in front it really hurts at the knees when the person is moving... Or trying to move his seat back... Which is not possible... and sitting with the legs into the aisle is also not a good idea as the flightcrew will bump into it and not even say &quot;I'm sorry&quot;...
Also no snackservice without paying... Even on this 2:30h flight I had....
And I was told that I can't change to an emergency-seat because they are all booked... When we took off there were still 7 free seats...
So totally not customerfriendly....

The advertisements of the company trying to tell you it is a modern airline are missleading. The aircraft was only 7 years old but it looks as if it had been in service since the 1990s.

Untortunately,  I was disappointed: the aircraft, which was only 7 years old, looked very degenerated. Furthermore, it was very dirty, so that I found some cigarette packs and empty bottles under and next to my seat and also the toilets were not clean at all. Another very negative aspect is the legroom, because it was very difficult for me (1,85 m) to sit comfortably.

"ReviewItem","835","Virgin has a lot of problems. I fly 250,000/yr in business. Virgin business class seat and cabin is pretty bad. The seats are narrow (I'm 5'6') and slant away from the window. Seats controls and entertainment controls are hard to access and not completely intuitive to use. Because seats slant, feet are whacked when people walk by. One person was so tall that his feet stuck into the aisle. Most people walked around to the front of the cabin to get to the bathroom. Can't see out the window, might as well close them up. Very hard to reach around the seat backs to close window or take photos. Food is great, flight crew service is ok. Having a bar in the cabin is not interesting to me, save the space and redesign the cabin.

In-flight entertainment contained many options in all categories, though the series of advertisements before each show can get annoying. Widebody A333s with the latest product was excellent and comfortable enough for a longhaul. The latest B738s had better leather seats but legroom was slightly less, though not necessarily much of an issue on the short haul regional flights they operate on.","","1100438706","70","1386767","false","Hafiz Bam","1","48","null","2 years ago","1.493049450032017E9","0","3","http://flightdiary.net/hafizbam"

Would recommend sitting in this cabin as there are only two rows and it feels very private. As the minicabin used to be part of the business cabin before refurb Malaysian haven't changed things in the cabin that used to be part of business such as mood lighting and a business class lavatory. The cabin was clean and looked new and the seats were very comfy. IFE had a good interface but not the largest selection. I had the bulkhead in row 1 and had plenty of space to spread out. Other seats looked fairly spacious.Crew were pretty friendly and frequently walked through the cabin. Food was very good. Lunch was a big meal consisting of Chicken with tomato sauce and potatoes aswell as a salad and some cold noodles. Pre landing snack was some cookies, a muffin and some ice cream. People worry about their two incidents and are cautious when flying Malaysian but I feel that they are stil a world class airline. I can't wait to fly them again!

However, there were some aspects of MH that needed improvement. specifically the cabin crew's attitude and simply just a lack of a 'happy smiling face'. This is something a frequent traveller like myself appreciates when being sat on a flight for close to 13hrs. Furthermore, the general cabin cleanliness onboard the A380 was also rather poor, the toilets didn't appear to have been cleaned by LHR ground staff following the arrival of the inbound flight.  Overall, the flight offered a pleasant experience as it was my first time on the A380- but I feel little things need to be improved in order for this journey to reach 5*.","","1040927362655734","100","1715944","false","Sam Crossley","1","5","null","11 months ago","1.493049450033397E9","0","1","http://flightdiary.net/SamCrossleyFlies"

"ReviewItem","638","Royal Brunei has been going through some transition recently, upgrading its fleet and on-board facilities.
As Brunei is a 'dry' country, the airline is also dry - ie no alcohol is served or offered on board. However, it is permissible to take your own small bottles on board to drink.
The cabin crew were excellent - a mix of Asian nationalities, all young, friendly and helpful.
On board catering was pretty standard flight food, but good quality and enjoyable - both my children enjoyed their special order child meals (Fish Fingers and mash on one sector was a big hit!)
We flew on the new 787 Dreamliner to Brunei from Dubai. The aircraft was clean and comfortable, the seats not bad for an economy cabin - the seating arrangement is 9 across in 3 blocks of 3 seats - not ideal for families of 4 traveling together.
The IFE was new, with interactive games which kept small people quiet for a while, however, the choice of films available on board was limited in number despite offering some of the latest releases. Have a back-up iPad available to keep children amused if needs be.
The biggest disappointment with the Royal Brunei experience wasn't with the airline itself, but with the terminal facilities in Brunei - its just not equipped of designed for a 777 load of transit passengers. If you can deal with a poor terminal during one of your transit stops, Royal Brunei is a reasonable option at good price for your journey.

"ReviewItem","507","I flew on Malaysia Airlines from KUL to SIN. First the flight was a 1h+  late and NO reason given. Then the boarding announcement was given. But nobody got to go through security (at the gate) until 30min later. People came running to the gate, but where quickly told that 'we are not boarding jet.' After all we get on the plane and I get to my seat. I find that the seat console is dirty and greasy. I started to watch a episode of The Big Bang Theory (30min) which I was able to finish before the take off. The IFE system was quite unresponsive and the content was good but old. The flight attendants almost  never smiled, but where effective. Then it was time to land. The flight landed 1h and 45 min late. On overall the flight was below avarage.","","","0","2101723","false","Henrik Hansten","3","7","null","1 week ago","1.493049459366087E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/21henrikh"
"ReviewItem","507","I'm sure when everything goes to plan MAS  is just fine. My experience of first checking in using the MAS phone app (online check-in, same thing) thinking my seat allocation was good to go but I was wrong. Thankfully I got to the airport with a good two hours to spare. MAS check-in ckerk was clueless about what was going on with the flight. An apparant aircraft change (still an A380 but somehow a different seat configuration. Not really convinced MAS would have a fleet of 6 x A380's and have different configs. That's what I was told was the issue). Consequently the seats I thought I had were no longer available and me being at the check-in two and a half hours before departure, firts at bag drop, could only give me a centre cabin seat. That's all that was left. That's not a big deal, someone has to sit there. The thing was that there was just no information forthcoming. This continued at the gate which was another joke. Got rejected at the gate for 'further checks' whatever that is. Waited in line over 30 mins, until after departure time for MAS to do something that took all of 30 seconds. No explanation even when I asked. 

The in-flight catering service on MAS is terrible. Let's be fair, the flight ticket was not expensive but that's hardly the point. Had I known I would have brought my own for the 14 hour flight.

Don't get me wrong. I fly a lot and these days with LCC's I don't expect much but come on MAS, get organised.","","1266645156","100","2042771","false","Alastair","3","4","null","2 months ago","1.493049459366533E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Barbour"

To be truthfully honest I never found any problems with them, I think I had one delay when leaving New Orleans once, apart from that always on time. The only downside I found is that the aircraft do seem quite old without any entertainment or maybe a small drop down aisle screen 4 rows ahead which you can't see a great deal on and the alcohol isn't free which when travelling to America for an awesome trip would be quite nice, but lets be honest American prices compared to BA and Virgin etc are dirt cheap, so you get what you pay for.

Commen&ccedil;ons par le service &agrave; bord lors de mon vol en business le personnel a &eacute;t&eacute; super sympas et aux petits soins. Pour ce qui est du vol en classe &eacute;co New-York Toronto j'ai pas vraiment vu de personnel de bord... mise &agrave; par celui de la business classe 1 si&egrave;ge devant moi. Pas de wifi. 
L'occupation &agrave; bord est bien, peut &ecirc;tre pas beaucoup de film int&eacute;ressant mais c'est un d&eacute;tail.

Le plus p&eacute;nible pour moi &eacute;tais le transit &agrave; New-York. Mon premier vol &eacute;tant retard&eacute; de presque 2 heures, j'ai loup&eacute; ma correspondance &agrave; New-York.( vol que AA m'avait propos&eacute; donc faisable) une fois &agrave; JFK, une personne m'&agrave; donn&eacute; une autre carte d'embarquement mais le vol &eacute;tant a LaGuardia  il m'a tr&egrave;s vite expliqu&eacute; comment m'y rendre. Tellement vite que j'ai du demand&eacute; 2 fois mon chemin apr&egrave;s lui. 

Une fois arriv&eacute; &agrave; Laguardia, ( par bus offert par la compagnie) j'ai plus qu'&agrave; attendre. Sauf qu'apr&egrave;s un vol manqu&eacute; celui l&agrave; est maintenant annul&eacute;. Donc &agrave; nouveau changement de vol. Et attente     &agrave; la porte d'embarquement. Une fois &agrave; bord on &agrave; du attendre encore 1 heure de plus car l'avion &eacute;tait bloqu&eacute; sur le tarmac. Je suis finalement arriv&eacute; a destination avec plus de 4h de retard.

A week or so before departure I went in to check flight details on my AA phone app but noticed my flight information was missing. I reloaded my confirmation number from booking and discovered the information was missing because the aircraft had changed to a B737-800. I looked at the dates around my departure and saw 3 days were the 737 and rest were the 787. Just my luck my departure was on a  737 date. The airline did not let me know of the equipment change but I am not sure if they are obligated to. I do like the B737 so I adjusted but I wouldn't have booked the ORD-LAX route since my origin airport is MSP. I just saw an domestic opportunity to fly on a Dreamliner and AA for the first time.

However, as soon as we stepped foot on the plane (which to be fair was nice inside) the crew ruined the experience. They were cold, one member of which barely contributed to the pre flight safety checks. As this flight was on behalf of BA with BA cups etc, I stupidly expected a BA service. Although I know the food was in a sealed box, I noticed crew sneezing over the trolley. Also when a passenger behind me piped up to ask a question, they were greeted with 'What?' I was also poured a cold cup of coffee of which I questioned...this also became such a hassle for them to get me a hot cup! I fly BA frequently, I'm so glad I didn't pay to fly business class on this trip! Also it's fortunate that Titan don't offer a regular scheduled service as they are the worst airline I have ever flown.

I would highly recommend flying with QR&acute;s business class. The old Premium Terminal was in a class of it&acute;s own, I have yet to try the lounges at the new terminal in Doha and looking forward to the next trip.
The new terminal seem to be great, but a limited number of seats at some gates result in people sitting on the floor, should not be like that on an airport with high standards opened in 2014!
One thing I find difficult with QR though, is to be able to use the milage points for upgrades and/or flights.

All services are perfect, there is abundant leg space between seats in economy class, and the food is very good. On long distance flights you also receive a small bag with a pair of socks if you have cold feet, a teeth brush and some toothpaste, and earplugs. Though they did not hand out this add-on one my first flight with them, they did on the returning one.","","100001395703843","33","1440016","false","Manuel Valentin","6","9","null","2 years ago","1.493049487648034E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/manuelvalentin"

"ReviewItem","6","The flight was fine for 3 hours. Nothing to complain about. The flight attendants were kind and friendly however there was no IFE or food or drink, not even water. Th menu looked very small so make sure to buy snacks before boarding. Comfy seats however they didn't recline. Decent legroom for a very cheap flight. If you live in Canada, definitely drive to America to fly with them. They offer amazing prices to the south!","","","0","2110809","false","Nathan Aberc","1","3","null","18 hours ago","1.493049505044342E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/aviationwinnipeg"

"ReviewItem","746","The plane boarded at the exact time indicated, which is perfect. The flight was very early and as the airport was not busy and there was only 1 other flight at the same time, we did not have any delay. Also, the duration of the flight was shorter than indicated, it took 1.40 hours athough it was announced as 1.55. The crew is helpful and doing their best to complete boarding as fast as possible which is also beneficial for the passengers. There is no free food and drink given during Sun Express flights, everything is paid. It is not a problem if you are buying the plane tickets low price, however, their flights are not cheap especially for the routes which they are monopol, such as İzmir - Diyarbakır. Istanbul flights take the same duration, also the taxation for Ataturk Airport is higher, however, half priced tickets can be found. Sun Express is enjoying their advantage freely. Also, there is no in-flight entertainment. Ensure that you have something with you to spend time.","","","100","1410809","false","bulker","1","3","null","2 years ago","1.493049507104287E9","0","2","http://flightdiary.net/bulker"

"ReviewItem","741","Short haul european flights with a Zurich layover. The first one was a longer sector (LHR-ZRH) and we received an hot breakfast snack with two drinks plus the typical chocolate before the descent. Got plenty of transit info before the landing on the screens. Second sector was really short (half an hour) and we got a bottle of water and again the chocolate (operated by Helvetic). Really lovely service and the interiors of both aircrafts were new and comfy. I would rate Swiss between the top european short haul airlines. For the first time I've got the feeling I was Flying something different from the typical EZY/RYR (quite better than BAW,KLM or AFR as an example).

Normally I don't care about those, but with the crazy boarding free-for-all that comes with a low cost airline, it's nice to get away from the crowd.  You also get a reserved seat, ie emergency exit row, which will in all likelihood be empty of anyone else.

"ReviewItem","1303","Can not fault Virgin Australia on my flight from Adelaide to the Gold Coast. I was upgraded to Business (this was done through a bidding process a week before my flight, after Virgin had emailed me asking if I wished to participate) at a fraction of a usual Business Class ticket. I was shown the breakfast menu and inflight entertainment by Cabin Crew, even before economy passengers had boarded the plane. The offer to wake me if I'm asleep when my breakfast was ready really did it for me. I havent flown in Business class for a while, and that was on Qantas. So all I can say is it was a very nice, comfortable experiance, not up to the Qantas standard, but well done Virgin.

As about the flight there is not personal IFE but there were screens showing greek destinations and some adds. The legroom was very good (Airbus A320). Just imagine with some airlines I have problems (1.86m) but here it was enough. The best part of this flight was the exceptional food. Greek breakfast. Greek yogurt with honey, greek traditional pies. Also we got served of juice and later coffee. In the breakfast box was also included wet lemon napkins.

The Boarding process in MAD was very good as they had boarded us from behind and all Priority passender to the front. 
What we do not understood we flew with an wide body and had the entertainment stuff at our seats, but in Economy and in Business the screens where off as well what I have to say is that in Economy and when I was upgraded to Business class the screens where in a very bad condition (button where broken). But on a continental 2 hours flight I don't take care about the In-Flight entertainment so I would book any other time a flight with Air Europa as the seat with is much more comfortable as in Iberia I would prefer Air Europe instead Iberia an flights to Spain.","","","0","1879463","false","Sebastian Winkler","1","6","null","6 months ago","1.493049529897173E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/sebastian_winkler"

Aerosvit left us stranded in a closed airport without food or water for the night to sleep on iron benches. No information, no hotel to stay in.

First of all , the SAAB 340 isn't even being produced anymore so they are old and ugly , the seats are very uncomfortable and the noise that the engines make is making everybody onbard deaf.

"ReviewItem","978","Just completed a few flights with Air Astana and I must say that I am quite impressed. Airlines from Central Asia have built up an appalling reputation, but Air Astana is really the exception to the rule. It's at least comparable to most European and American flag carriers in economy, better even in business on short haul due to dedicated business class seats: something you won't see on European airlines anymore. Snack and drinks are included, just as at least 20 kilos of luggage. The in flight magazine is pretty thick and comes in three languages. My long haul aircraft had no personal in flight entertainment system. On the other hand, short haul equipment had general video entertainment on board. Something not available on most European flag carriers either. Also luggage was handled fast and properly and all my flights were on time (not surprising with turnaround times of one hour...). Anyway, I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.  I read that they are in the process of revamping their identity and changing their logo. I hope they won't, as I think the current one is quite pretty!

"ReviewItem","668","It's Ryanair, so not too much to be expected, haha! On time departure and arrival, but one thing that I wasn't happy with was the fact that all passengers had to put their hand baggage in the hold, and only got to carry necessary, valuable goods into the cabin (albeit free)... a bit frustrating if you don't want to wait at the carousel at the destination waiting for the bags to arrive, and don't have a backpack to put in passports, etc.

Flight crew were lovely - captain's announcements were informative, and cabin crew seemed nice.... cabin crew manager's announcements were muffled and shouty, so couldn't hear a word of information being said.

Usual range of food and drink available for a high price, with no in-flight entertainment present with the cheap price.

"ReviewItem","668","The flight returning was good. It arrived 10 minutes late, but it was not too major. Boarding was relatively quick and I took my seat, 30F. We took off at 10:58 local time (9:58 GMT), 20 minutes behind schedule. But, we managed to make up time and arrived 1 minute ahead of schedule at 11:34. 

We ascended steeply and quickly, eventually levelling out at 38,000 feet. There was some minor turbulence over Northern Germany. We routed across over Hannover and then Amsterdam before flying over the English Channel. We began our descent once we reached Felixstowe and turned WNW. We flew over Stansted and Luton Airports before following the M1 motorway before final descent into East Midlands Airport. Landing was good and there were no problems.

The service was good, if you can put up with the constant need for the cabin crew to be selling goods. I had a hot dog on the flight, which wasn't great, but it was still food. The menu was still very good, for a low cost airline. 

Overall, it was a good flight, which was cheap and convenient for me.","","100000506095513","44","1368414","false","Liam Tallon","19","37","null","3 years ago","1.493049572051947E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/AviationEagle32"
"ReviewItem","668","I was due to leave East Midlands at 18:40 onboard FR1638 to Berlin Schonefeld. The plane didn't arrive until around 19:00, but boarding was fast and we departed at 19:11. I was sat in seat 30A. The flight was full. The ascent from East Midlands was steep, but fast. We travelled over to Doncaster Airport before turning east across North Lincolnshire and along the Humber Estuary. We climbed to 29,000 feet before cruising with the sun setting as we travelled over the North Sea. Th journey was shorter due to a tailwind. In the end the flight was only 5 minutes behind schedule. Landing at 21:40 local time (20:40 GMT) at Berlin Schonefeld. The touchdown at Schonefeld was very hard, but that was the only mishap on the journey. 

The service on behind was good, but not brilliant.The cabin crew were good. The in-flight food was expensive, but that is expected. the journey time is relatively short and just a drink and a snack is enough. The interior of the plane looked faded especially the Ryanair yellow. 

Overall, the trip was nothing more or less than what I had paid for. The flights were relatively cheap and the service was local to me. I would only fly with them again if I needed a quick or cheap flight and if I couldn't find an airline travelling the same route, that would be convenient for me.

Their airports tend to be far away from city centres, but it's not always bad. It gives you a chance to see some of the countryside and gives you a sense of the country's personality.

Crew speaks very low and unclearly in the microphone. The prerecorded safety demonstration makes me wanna sleep. Still a little bit much talking from the crew.. Crew was friendly enough, but could been better. Deplaning was good and effective. The price is why we choosed Ryanair, otherways Norwegian is so much better.

"ReviewItem","440","First time using KLM. I was interested to see what it was like. The aircraft arrived on time and we soon began boarding which was relatively speedy. However, we were 35 minutes behind our scheduled departure time before we pushed back from our stand due to someone being lifted onto the plane, but some of the time was made up during the flight, so it wasn't too bad.

The flight was very good, quick and speedy. The interior was nice, quite spacious onboard and the seats were comfortable. A complimentary drinks and snacks service was provided due to the short length of the flight. The service was very good and the cabin crew were friendly and polite. The aircraft did lack IFE which many airliners in the USA do now include but due to the short length of the flight it wasn't a major problem.

Our descent into Amsterdam was smooth and we quickly reached our gate after landing. Very good service and would use KLM again for many flights in the future.","","100000506095513","44","1448219","false","Liam Tallon","1","37","null","2 years ago","1.493049582341745E9","0","2","http://flightdiary.net/AviationEagle32"
"ReviewItem","440","I got a chance to fly AMS-YUL on the MD-11 four days before its retirement. I have to say it was the best flying experience of my life. I had seat 12A in the first row of Economy and it turned out I couldn't have chosen better: seat 12B was empty, so me and my travel companion (sitting in 12C) could use it as storage space, therefore having plenty of room for our legs and elbows. The IFE system was excellent. The screen seemed a bit small in the beginning, but it turned out to be adequate. The choice of movies and TV shows was great - on long-haul flights I usually run out of movies but this time I ran out of time! And the food was just delicious. I never would've thought I'd get to eat pasta, pizza and ice cream on an airplane, let alone on the same flight, but KLM surprised me. The cabin crew could maybe have been a bit friendlier, but it didn't really matter. The flight was a great experience overall. I definitely recommend KLM to everyone - their long-haul product is the best I've ever experienced.

KLM Dutch Royal Airlines: Royal price but budget comfort. Long distance flight delayed in both directions. One extra row of seat make the plain too tight.

To make the matter worse, in Mumbai airport passengers are supposed to check out the baggage, clear custom formalities and re check-in at Jet counter. This is quite ridiculous.

In the morning they served a breakfast with a muffin. This is very frugal at any standards. No in flight wifi offered, not even a paid service.","","884880507","43","1373321","false","Anamitra Ghatak","2","86","null","3 years ago","1.493049587019977E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/AnamitraGtk"

But.. FD is not have WiFi at airport likes some Low-Cost airlines in Thailand and certainly, not have on board too.","","100000283198008","100","1375422","false","Chinnapat W.","1","2","null","3 years ago","1.493049598385145E9","0","2","http://flightdiary.net/patshutter"

"ReviewItem","677","Despite being the 'best' (or actually least bad) airline in the Nordics, the airline can make a few HUGE improvements with just a little effort. Unfortunately, they refuse to do so. Service on board in Go is appaling, as even some water costs you 25 NOK or 3 euro (although not a big miss on short flights), as 'free' water is not always available. Plus is an expensive joke if you're already a StarAlliance Gold member and if you don't need EuroBonus points (or most certainly will need a rebooking), as the seats are the same as in Go, there is no middle seat blocking, and on board service is a joke there as well. Most food is inedible and quite expensive (I love their muffin, though, it's the only good thing in the catering on board). Staff is usually quite ok, most flights are on time, lounges in CPH, OSL and ARN are nice.  Entertainment is totally lacking. Even their on board magazine is no more than a big advertisement collection. Wifi is free for status customers and people flying Plus, otherwise it's paid. But it's not available on all flights... Too bad the airline doesn't respect their best customers when it comes to upgrading due to overbooking or with luggage handling, or even with priority boarding. Apparently the airline believes that 'priority luggage' means: should be last on belt. In addition, the airline is very expensive. It's just that they serve most routes I fly and that my employer wants me to fly with them (or Lufthansa if SAS is not available. Guess what I ended up most with? :) ) due to a company agreement (and that I have a gold card there), otherwise I would have moved my business elsewhere. But then, as said, they're relatively good for Scandinavian standards and choices up here are limited...

Drinks were served in plastic glasses even though SAS announced the relaunch of real Orrefors-glasses in SAS Plus on European-flights. Almost short-haul I've done with SAS had more friendly staff than the purser on this flight. SAS-staff are usually the friendliest and most professional in European aviation industry.

"ReviewItem","304","Great staff, both flights were extremely smooth, probably the best landing I've ever had coming into Helsinki, didn't even use reverse thrust on a fully loaded A333. On my return flight my in-flight entertainment system froze about 1h30m into my 9h flight, not very good. But flying over Greenland there were clear skies so the views kept me busy for a good 2 hours. Would definitely fly Finnair again, especially for the price!","","768594046","83","1451750","false","Ryan O'Reilly","1","14","null","2 years ago","1.493049632088979E9","0","3","http://flightdiary.net/ryan78"
"ReviewItem","304","Our national airline.... trying to find its place in the fierce flight markets. New light ticket category includes only one hand luggage of 8kg. This is a clever trick, now they can sell extra luggage for 15-30eur/one way. Customers are often surprised about this. It causes long lines on customer service &amp; check in desks. 
Fleet is a mix of old and new. Some older A340's are awful but luckily replaced by the end of 2015. 
New A350s will have on board wifi. Only.
Customer service is slow and not friendly. Best way to contact is via fb. Via phone it costs whopping 3eur/min!
On board staff is getting old because Finnair doesnt hire new people, only wait them to retire :) Their partner airline Norra (used mostly for many domestic routes) have younger staff with pleasant service attitude. Always.
No meals on short/Europe flights. Only coffee, tea and blueberry juice :) Sure you can buy but it is quite pricy. Long haul meals are free (not alco) but quality is so so. Business class service is great, full flat beds on newer planes. 
Entertainment systems selection is quite poor. Older A340s have only tiny screens and sometimes not even working :)
Service on board is also painfully slow! Staff also talk loudly about their own personal things at the back of the plane. Not very professional. 
Baggage handling is slow and rough (partly their fault because airline is responsible). 
Usually Finnairs schedules are too tight and they often run late. Boardind calls are often made too early. It is a bit chaotic too. 
Having said this, you should know one last thing: Finnair is maybe the safest airline on this planet. Well kept planes, excellent maintenance and best pilots. Also hub airport of Helsinki is a fast transfer port. Finnair is always a safe pick for the journey.","","928117843898428","84","1439472","false","LasseL","1","12","null","2 years ago","1.493049632090217E9","0","2","http://flightdiary.net/lepolal"

Their fare policy is rather inconsistent, some times you pay scandalous prices (one-way economy in Europe), and you may pay 3 times less in throwing your return ticket away, sometimes got get remarkable deals (long-haul business).

"ReviewItem","34","I had an ok, but not great experience with Air France. My first and only so far flight with them has been JFK-CDG. While onboard services were decent to very good, the crew was not very friendly (or they were faking being friendly at least, that's what I felt) -- I didn't feel the warmth of the KLM crews for instance. They also seemed to be a bit unprofessional at times - the FAs were unfamiliar with the PA system and kept either talking to each other while everyone heard it, or sending out public announcements that kept being interrupted. They were also speaking into the microphone either too loudly or too low. 
Food and the IFE were good - up to KLM-AF standards I would say, but it seemed as tho the flight attendants really tried to hide disliking their jobs and/or us.","","1060372752","73","1419708","false","Andy","31","29","null","2 years ago","1.49304965085026E9","1","0","http://flightdiary.net/andy17"

You flight will probably allow you to spend some time in the &quot;new&quot; terminal that is close to the AF gates. Many, many food options there and very comfortable seating in the waiting area.

Generally speaking, AF longhaul is average for European carrier in terms of service, comfort and punctuality. Economy seats are tight, in-flight entertainment consists of VOD and decent-sized seatback screen. Some seats have limited legroom because of IFE box - check Seatguru. You get free glass of champagne (not with meals), free drinks including alcoholic and average food (not haute cuisine). Service is efficient without much charm. The major problem is CDG, where change of terminals can take a long time with long lines for security, and chance of your luggage not making transfer even if you do. The refurbished AF terminals are fine, though food and drink prices are very high, like 3 euro for a can of coke or small coffee.","","","0","1454851","false","robin hugo","6","3","null","2 years ago","1.493049656799586E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/robinhugo"

"ReviewItem","34","I was forced to dispatch my hand luggage although it was within the legal standard size.
This happened although I was one of the first passengers aboard and without the flight crew even checking wether there was space or not.
People with more than one hand luggage should be asked first to dispatch their own, before demanding the rest of the passengers. This was not the case in this flight. A lot of people had 2 and 3 cases but as it was getting late, they were not asked to do it. Not polite when you've asked the first 100 passangers to dispatch luggage. It seems company policy.
As a passenger I have an assigned space under my seat to put my luggage should it be necessary. I should not be penalized because of others.","","664257164","0","1634104","false","Ricardo Sim&otilde;es","5","1","null","1 year ago","1.493049657123347E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/roitos"
"ReviewItem","34","Never had a bad experience with them. I had one big delay in 2009, when the plane of my connecting flight got struck by a lightning. We had a delay of over 3 hours at CDG because of that. In this time, Air France organized a new crew and a new aircraft for us. They couldn&acute;t take the original crew because they prepared a brand-new Embraer 190 for us and the original plane was an Embaer 145. The seats where still covered in foil.

Airbus 330 planes are brand new too but entertainment system already outdated. Seats on A330's economy class are &quot;fake leather &quot; so it's not nice on long hauls. Staff are ice cold and not very friendly. But at the same time they are very effective. English skills are so so and it's hard to understand what they say. Meals on board are always free but no alcohol service anymore. Sometimes flights are cancelled without any clear reason. When this happens their customer service is awful BUT i managed to get a refund eventually after few months. But first they let me on my own and this i never forgive.

Those days are long gone. Unfortunately it got to the point in which its profile resembles a low cost airline with delusional self views of grandeur. Maybe the merging with Lan will change it for better.

"ReviewItem","457","The flight crew service was really bad, at least two of them (a woman and man). I was 4months and1/2 pregnant, and the crew treated me really badly. They sat me on a sit that did not get straight, and they wanted me to pretend it was working for departure and landing, meaning I would have to leave the sit straight without resting my back on it... which make no sense at all This shows how little they care about security measures, risking the safety of a pregnant woman. Why wouldn't they change me to another sit? no idea, but they got quite cross with me, making me feel responsible when I said I was not going to pretend to sit straight as gravity is very strong at departure time, and I was already too tired, after flown 23 hours already. They were not nice, they did not apologize for giving me a bad seat and treated me as I was a disobedient passenger in front of everyone, which of course made me extremely frustrated and angry for the rest of my trip. Not a nice way to start one's holiday. Very unfair treatment.","","","33","2094274","false","Ro","1","16","null","2 weeks ago","1.493049686689329E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Alcaman"

"ReviewItem","457","LAN is an exceptional airline and exceeded my expectations, The only problem was in the flight LA3505 (BOG-GRU), which had a 5-hour delay due to a engine problem. 
  
  In the first leg, LA3506 (GRU-BOG), colombian newspapers were available at the finger when we was boarding the 767-300ER. The airplane was clean and well-kept, the seats in Economy (2-3-2 configuration) was excellent (for a Y class) and the IFE was also very good. The food service was surprisingly good - a hot meal, a breakfast and water/coffee available during all the flight. There was also red and white whine in the hot dish. 
 In the other flights, BOG-ADZ, ADZ-BOG, BOG-CTG and CTG-BOG, short-haul domestic flights, the service was also very good for such small flights. The food was quite normal, but a comedy show screened at the plane's televisions was excellent. Despite to the engine problem delay and also a one-hour delay at Cartagena - due to a ATC problem, which closed the airport and was absolutely not fault of the airline - our experience with LAN was very good, also better than the experiences with COPA on the flights GRU-PTY-MCO-PTY-GRU, American on CNF-MIA-CNF and British on GRU-LHR-CPH-LHR-GRU.

"ReviewItem","124","Where to begin?  If you are looking for an ontime, efficient experience - you need to go elsewhere.  In 13 Flybe flights this year only 3 have left on time, and you get no information about delays when they happen (they just expect you to sit around waiting with no announcements).

The reason for this is the type of flight they operate - morning flights tend to be delayed by only a few minutes, but all those little delays throughout their 10+ sectors in a day add up, and although they try to be a LCC the turnaround time is unrealistically low, causing delays unless things run exceptionally smoothly.

Add in weather factors at the smaller airports they serve and cancellations are a given - I was once bussed from Waterford to Belfast (6 hours drive away) as the weather was bad at Waterford.  Despite the fact we drove past Dublin Airport with multiple daily flights to BHX on other airlines - we had to fly back with Flybe.

Once on board, the staff are usually very friendly and helpful however, and the buy on board service is pretty reasonably priced too.","","","75","1391057","false","inflight Video","1","9","null","2 years ago","1.493049693144891E9","0","2","http://flightdiary.net/noelmg"
"ReviewItem","124","FlyBe staff are pretty good - but their systems are dreadful and their policy of selling cheap advance tickets and then change the flight dates and times is very poor.

We bought a number of what we thought were cheap tickets only to find that FlyBe changed not only the flight times, but the dates too in some cases. Tickets can only be changed by calling an 0845 number which is really expensive when calling internationally. Subsequent changes to tickets are &pound;30 a time. Their computers had no way of finding bookings by surname - so I'm pretty sure that a few changes down the road we have lost a few bookings. 

We may fly with them again - perhaps. But we won't be fooled into buying advance tickets that look much cheaper than they are..

Also - who dreamt up the 07:45 Sunday flight from Southend to Caen? There is no London train that arrives in time on a Sunday... I suspect it will be a quiet flight which they will then cancel because no-one us using it. Perhaps if we could get there by public transport, more people would use the flight?","","","100","1421368","false","Peter Blair","1","3","null","2 years ago","1.493049693145548E9","0","1","http://flightdiary.net/peterblair"

I prefer Airbus fleets of Air Berlin because they are younger than the 737 fleets and they have a better cabin quality !

"ReviewItem","579","Oman Air never makes any claims to be a great airline. But the way they behave, there's no hope for them either. 

So, to that extent, one didn't expect much from it. 

The food was average. The black mark was, we were carrying an expensive camera that got stolen in the bus that was ferrying passengers from the waiting room to the plane. While most people are quick to blame third world countries for something like this. 

I found Oman Air extremely disinclined to help. 

Anyway, god help the airline. It feels slightly better than a city bus.

"ReviewItem","469","The onboard service is in general perfect and everything is free of charge.

The board entertainment depends on the airplane type and of course also on the destinations.

All their Boeing 737 series aircrafts are equipped with overhead screens + in seat audio system.

The smaller airplanes like ERJ145 and DH8 have no screens in the cabin because they are mainly used for short flights of minimum 20 minutes and maximum 2,5 hours.

Please note: The Boeing type aircrafts are in general flying charter flights for the holiday Tour operator called Luxair Tours.

The smaller airplanes are mainly flying for Luxair Luxembourg Airlines. They are serving European city (Schengen) destinations and connecting international airport hubs with Luxembourg-Findel. 

All together with Luxair Cargo &amp; Luxair Services, they all belong to Luxair Group.

When you are a little bit flexible, I recommend to keep your eyes opened for Excellent promotions. .

"ReviewItem","736","Flight delayed 2 1/2 hours by poor scheduling on Southwest's part; our plane was a half-hour late, and then we were told the pilots were arriving on another flight that was also delayed. Why so many delayed flights on a bright, sunny day? No new estimate was given for when the flight would leave. We were just left hoping it would be soon. Almost missed a graduation even that I had previous had a 3-hour buffer to get to. Good job, Southwest.","","","0","1431107","false","Robert Goldberg","6","6","null","2 years ago","1.493049705454164E9","1","0","http://flightdiary.net/fuzzy901"

"ReviewItem","736","Southwest Airlines has been acclaimed for their low fares, and that turns the table for a lot of travelers. However, the biggest problem I have, since it's an all economy class airline, is how closely they put the seats. It's almost like a pack of 160 sardines in a Boeing 737. The WiFi is good for $8 a day, no matter how many flight you take, and good luck trying to work in these crowded quarters. If you want a good seat, get in the early A group (preferably A1-15) in order to get a decent seat in the front of the plane.","","","0","1588446","false","Kevin Roy","4","7","null","1 year ago","1.493049705621699E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/SkyHighTraveler"

I find it very disconcerting that the cabin crew (who tend to be a bit &quot;ecky-thump&quot;) are usually younger than the aircraft - although they're now picking up brand-new 737s, so that's good.  They insist on trying to flog all sorts of stuff in their &quot;Sky Shop&quot; although their inflight &quot;adult snack box' is one of the best no-nonsense good value meals you're ever likely to eat at 33000 feet.

"ReviewItem","260","Boarding was relatively quick. We pushed back at 14:10 from stand 400R. I would say the plane was 95% full. We taxied to runway 28 and took off relatively quickly. We continued straight out before banking right and doing a 180. We continued our ascent to our cruising altitude at 33000ft.

A drinks and snacks service began as we passed over the Irish Sea. I had the adult snack box which was alright. The interior is a fairly standard look, although the seats were very comfortable. 

We met the British Coast as we passed over Merseyside we turned right and continued down over the West Midlands. We began our descent as we neared Luton. We joined the holding pattern for Heathrow carrying out one circuit before getting permission for approach. We continued over North London heading east at a fast pace. Just over Stratford we banked right lining up for finals into Runway 27R. Finals was smooth and touchdown was alright with one wheel touching down before the other. We vacated the runway and began our taxi around Terminal 3 which took a few minutes. We pulled onto our stand at Terminal 2. Disembarkation was relatively quick for a full flight. Terminal 2 was no effort to get through and I soon found myself on my way home.

"ReviewItem","260","Boarding began at 09:20 - 10 minutes ahead of time. It didn't take too long as there were only about 20 people onboard the aircraft. We pushed back at 09:35 and the pilot began a very fast taxi to runway 20. We were soon in the air which took no time due to how few people were onboard. 

We climbed out of Doncaster heading across the Pennines. There was some minor turbulence during the flight. We routed across to Holyhead and then over the Irish Sea. 

The interior on this ATR was clean and bright. The seats were extremely slim and mine was starting to become uncomfortable as we neared the end of our flight. There was a more limited (Non-complimentary) drinks and snacks service than compared with the mainline Aer Lingus service. 

Cruising altitude was about 22,000ft. We banked left and began our descent as we neared the Irish Coast. Finals into Dublin was steep and we were battling some strong gusts. Touchdown was quite hard. Vacating the runway we taxied to a remote stand near the T1 low cost pier at Dublin.

"ReviewItem","286","Flown Jet2 many times before. They are a very good airline for one that is low cost. Most of its destinations are for leisure. 

The plane was ready on time for departure. But, it was held for half an hour while Air Traffic Control dealt with other flights. We took off on Runway 23R and climbed steadily before levelling out at 34,000 ft. 

The flight headed South across West England, then across to Paris before turning South west. The flight then began to descend as we passed Barcelona and the descent was beautiful with clear skies and a blue Mediterranean. We flew over the north of the Menorca before turning South-east over the sea. The plane then banked steeply left to line up for final approach into Menorca Airport. We arrived promptly and disembarkation was relatively quick.

The Cabin crew were helpful and pleasant. The services were the usual as per any low cost airline. Although they do play the music from the adverts before any announcement from cabin crew, which can be very irritating.

Overall, my experience was very positive and I would use them again.","","100000506095513","44","1368725","false","Liam Tallon","2","37","null","3 years ago","1.493049716280731E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/AviationEagle32"

Bit shocked today as coming in from Montreal (international flight) that BA decided to park the 777 at a line maintenance parking spot and bus us to the terminal, rather then at an air bridge!

We flew faster than normal speed (without going overspeed) and arrived at Lisbon with only few minutes late.

Club Europe service was great however as flight take off at 15:25, we were given snack although I would prefer hot meal than just snack!

Heathrow Terminal 5 is their own terminal which has got to be the best terminal when it comes to amount of services and quality in general. Their fleet is usually good though must admit in most of their planes I have been on the cleanliness hasn't been great, even in the new planes like the A380, you can see coffee smears and messes. On one 777s there was a small hole in the side below the window where you could see parts of the fuselage. Their in flight entertainment on their new and upgraded planes is good. However their older fleet like 747s they're clunky and hard to use. Usually a good selection of movies and games. Food is always great, even in economy.

"ReviewItem","113","The flight crew were professional and friendly. Everyone was welcomed aboard and there was priority boarding for status holders, business class passengers and passengers requiring assistance or with young children. Boarding for the rest then commenced in rows. Overall it took approximately 15 minutes for a nearly full flight. 

The service onboard consisted of a croissant of ham and cheese along with refreshments of juices and tea/coffee. More than ample for this 2 and a quarter hour flight. 

The inflight entertainment consisted of a moving map on the overhead screens and 2 inflight magazines (Business Life and High Life). Although these 2 magazines wouldn't have kept me occupied for the whole flight they were an interesting read. I had also purchased a newspaper and brought my iPad so I wasn't bored.

"ReviewItem","113","British Airways is definitely an airline I'd fly with multiple times again. Boarding the plane was easy and I found my seat quite quickly, the flight crew were very helpful. This is plane-specific, but on my plane there wasn't any in-flight entertainment. However, this is simply because the plane, a Boeing 737-400, is quite old itself but British Airways have had them for a long time. There wasn't a backseat screen to watch videos or anything on, and also there wasn't any in-flight WiFi. I had some films on my tablet I watched though, so the flight felt like it didn't take long at all.","","100002640095589","0","1407524","false","Harry Fitchett","20","4","null","2 years ago","1.493049737119767E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/harryfitchett"

"ReviewItem","113","Short haul is not different anymore from EZY or RYR, so it's almost the same experience those days. They are giving you snacks but it's still not worth an higher price, but sometimes the price for main carriers is lower than EZY/RYR. The entire experience is nice, flight crew is smiley and the pilots keeps passengers informed about each possible information that can be interesting (taxi infos about how much to wait for takeoff in LHR, etc.). The only issue can be the airplane: older interiors doesn't have any screen to show the route and flight data and the seats are quite &quot;old&quot; and sometimes dirty.

So I booked the flight with my frequent flyer miles, and just gone to Terminal 3.

"ReviewItem","113","One of the better full service airlines. Excellent and easy to use online check-in service, professional staff, reasonable food and (if you want) generous with drink.

For those flying in or out of Heathrow, BA use terminal 5 as their hub. I think this is the airport's best terminal.

Their airlines programme is not as good as used to be, I've had mixed experiences with their time keeping and sometimes aircraft interiors can look a little dated. 

But overall, I think BA provide an above average flying experience.

"ReviewItem","113","Now, the british flagship airlines has gone low-cost(tm) is somewhat okay for some, but not really prestigious. But how did they  manage to make A320 seats so narrow and cramped even more than those found lowcost B737, is beyond my understanding. Reminds me those asian local buses, where they pack 5 seats in a row in a small minivan, or FUBAR. The pilots were probably thinking they are still flying RAF fighters, making quite unusually sharp turns all the way. Also the (young) crew generally ends an announcement with question sign? every sentense? or every command? probably in a modern way? that's not realy reassuring, like they do not know what they are going to do?

Otherwise the crew are very polite and helpful? things are usually smooth? and they eventually get you there?

They force you to check in your hand baggage even respecting all their regulations (which are very limited, for instance 8 kg as maximum). I can understand it with a propeller plane or similar, but not with an A320. Later it is explained when you see that you are in an overcrowded matchbox (excess of rows by tightening the seats) and you see how the crew works...

Moreover, they are very unpunctual, and one of the causes is that the luggage is weighted by the crew very late for the limit of 8 kg (in order to win extra money) and for checking in the hand baggage or simply they are checking the commas of your name in your boarding pass.

"ReviewItem","1169","Could not be happier to fly with Tiger! - A real test of an airline is what they do when something goes wrong.. This unfortunately happened to me once when I flew Tiger,  in which I accidentally dropped a small bag (which contained important medication) whilst waiting for the departure at the gate in Melbourne - It was only once on the aircraft that   I noticed this and immediately notified the cabin manager - All the tiger staff went out of their way to assist me. 

After they were unable to find it after searching the terminal I was offered the option to be de-planed to try to find it myself (Which I didn't choose as I was unaware if I would have to buy another ticket, etc and wanted to minimise any disruption to the service) and thus I resigned myself to never seeing it again (and a big fuss once arriving home to get it replaced) :(

Anyway back to Tiger, as I decided to stay on the flight they told me that I'd be able to follow up with the ground crew once we landed at Coolangatta.

Anyway at the end of the flight when I had settled that my stupid accident had lost my bag forever (and pondering how I'd explain that to the library too)... 

I was shocked when the ground crew at the Gold Coast told me that they had found my bag and they had arranged for it to be urgently expedited to me on their next flight -  Funnily enough they were concerned about this news and were very apologetic because I would have to return later that evening (They only had a few planes then and I arrived on the 2nd out of the 3 daily flights that were scheduled!).

Anyway that is my little ordeal - But on all the other occasions I flew with them I have found the staff to be great (Better than some of the grumpy Headmistress types I've encountered on some *ahem 'Full service Airlines').

The only real advice on how to have a good trip with tiger is to make sure you understand the T&amp;C's - Arrive early and invest in a little digital luggage scale that you can take with you to make sure you are below the strict weight limits - Don't forget the &quot;Tiger Shuffle&quot; of balancing any excess luggage evenly between each allowance including your person (which is not weighed!).","","","0","1342366","false","Heath Palmer","1","3","null","3 years ago","1.493049747792078E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/HeathRussiaGc"

Actually above everything was the landing that the captain did,absolutely stunning.The smoothest landing i have experienced by far.Without a doubt AIR INDIA is the best airline of India and looking forward to flying with them in the future.

"ReviewItem","1562","The flight was really short, it took about 40 minutes. Anyway flight attendant served a snack with a beverage. The airplane was nice, clean and boarding and deplaning was really fast. Flight crew was kind and helpful and at the terminal parking dock they let me visit the cockpit. The flight was a pleasant journey.","","10207677166475620","100","1448044","false","Andrea Cossu","1","3","null","2 years ago","1.493049749839586E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Andrea93"

"ReviewItem","1567","The onboard product is very uncomfortable however the ground staff were great. I had a complicated booking, and they were not able to tag my bag electronically for the three legs so simply reverted to the old-fashioned hand-written tags instead of saying 'pick them up at the next airport and recheck'.

"ReviewItem","1567","Even though it is a cheaper version of Iberia and more like Transavia or any other low fare airline, the leg space is very similar to that of Ryanair and EasyJet. Cabin crew were nice looking ladies, but they served with uninteresting faces.  Next to that flight was fine, an on time flight!","","10208555437510485","85","1461142","false","Thomas van Woerkom","1","7","null","1 year ago","1.493049750458358E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/FlyingThomas"

Only conclusion for me:  never again will I fly with Iberia Express!","","100001047952172","0","1424107","false","Andre de Zwart","1","1","null","2 years ago","1.493049750458893E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Masterdrew"

"ReviewItem","43","Air India planes, typically have a little more legroom than the other private airlines. 

But I was surprised to see that the legroom in the emergency exit was ABOUT THE SAME as other exits. This is a first for me and very unlike any airline. 

The food was average. We got some cheese sandwiches and  juice for breakfast. What about coffee or tea for an early morning flight? This was very unlike an Air India flight. 

But the flight took off on time, and landed on time.  Again, very unlike an Air India flight.  ","","719358997","71","1657847","false","Anindya Banerjee","2","32","null","1 year ago","1.493049751194894E9","0","0","http://flightdiary.net/Anindya"

"ReviewItem","1368","Juneau Airlines is a good airline. We flew from Shenzhen to Shanghai Hongqiao (1202). The airplane (A321) was very new and the cabin design was innovative. I noticed how thin but still comfortable the seats were. Our food was served without a tray and deplaning was a bit chaotic but other than that, I was really satisfied and it gave an overall better impression than China Southern or Shenzhen Airlines (the alternatives).","","1685870738328830","100","1927601","false","Joschua","1","2","null","5 months ago","1.493049752811848E9","0","1","http://flightdiary.net/joschpilot"
